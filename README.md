# tokio-zookeeper

A (still WIP) crate that provides an asynchronous client interface to
[Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/).

# Live-coding

The crate is under development as part of a live-coding stream series
intended for users who are already somewhat familiar with Rust, and who
want to see something larger and more involved be built. For
futures-related stuff, I can also highly recommend @aturon's in-progress
[Async in Rust
book](https://aturon.github.io/apr/async-in-rust/chapter.html).

You can find the recordings of past sessions in [this YouTube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFgY2faCIYjJZv_RluGkTlKt).
This crate started out in [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMuk8Rn9HBg), and got fleshed out
more in [this follow-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-Fsu-aM0_A). I
recommend you also take a look at the [ZooKeeper Programming
Guide](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.12/zookeeperProgrammers.html)
if you want to follow along. To get updates about future streams, follow

# Thank you

For each of the projects I build, I like to thank the people who are
willing and able to take the extra step of supporting me in making these
videos on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jonhoo) or
[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/jonhoo/). You have my most sincere
gratitude, and I'm so excited that you find what I do interesting enough
that you're willing to give a stranger money to do something they love!
